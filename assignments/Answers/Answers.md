1- A smart contract is basically a piece of code with its own logics that runs on the blockchain under certains conditions. They are deployed by sending an ETH transaction which contains the compiled code of the contract, without specifying the recipient of that transaction.
What we do is basically use an IDE, such as REMIX, to compile our code and deploy, i.e, send a transaction with our code compiled to the blockchain, where it will forever run.

2- On Ethereum, Gas is the currency used to pay to execute a function. Users pay for this gas with ETH, hence the importance of optimizing our contract such as the functions require less gas to be executed, hence the users will spend less money to interact with the blockchain.

3- Hash is an algorithm to map data of any size to fixed-size values. It is used to encrypt data since it is a secure and more flexible way of retrieving a data compared to other data structure types, since it stores data in an array format, with each data corresponding to a specific value, index. So we can easily search through it and do operations faster than other methods.

4- We can do this by using ZK-Proofs, where each object has
