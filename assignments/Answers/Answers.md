1- A smart contract is basically a piece of code with its own logics that runs on the blockchain under certains conditions. They are deployed by sending an ETH transaction which contains the compiled code of the contract, without specifying the recipient of that transaction.
What we do is basically use an IDE, such as REMIX, to compile our code and deploy, i.e, send a transaction with our code compiled to the blockchain, where it will forever run.

2- On Ethereum, Gas is the currency used to pay to execute a function. Users pay for this gas with ETH, hence the importance of optimizing our contract such as the functions require less gas to be executed, hence the users will spend less money to interact with the blockchain.

3- Hash is an algorithm to map data of any size to fixed-size values. It is used to encrypt data since it is a secure and more flexible way of retrieving a data compared to other data structure types, where it stores data in an array format, with each data corresponding to a specific value, index. So we can easily search through it and do operations faster than other methods.

4- Since each color has its own wavelenght, we could simply run a Hertz experiment to determine the wavelenght of the color of each object, then associate that said wavelenght with its respective color and tell the result to the blind person.
Alternatively, we could use ZK-Proofs, where we prove a characteristic of a certain thing without actually showing that characteristic. In our case, we want to first validate the color of the objects, through a zk-method. Then we could simply show the proof of that reliable and secure method to the blindd person to prove the color of those two objects.
